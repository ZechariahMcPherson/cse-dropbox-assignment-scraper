# cse dropbox assignment scraper

Creator: G. Zechariah McPherson

This project was supposed to remove the incessant clicking that was required to view assignments in UofSC's computer science dropbox. I graduated before I could finish the project. Thus I no longer had access to finish it.


Some of the technologies I used: 
* [Python 3.6](https://docs.python.org/3/)
* [Scrapy 1.3](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
